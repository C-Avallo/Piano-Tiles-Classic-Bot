# Piano-Tiles-Classic-Bot
A bot to play the classic version of piano tiles through bluestacks

- Place bluestacks in the far left side of your screen. <p>
- Make sure <i>byte Black =</i> the black tiles' RBG red on YOUR computer's display. <p>
- Run the program (Either Pixel or PathSelector: Pixel.java solves the mode using the hotkeys autocreated by bluestacks, PathSelector solves using the mouse) <p>
- Watch it go! <p>
<b> Note: Unless the delay is great enough on your computer, this program will stop, as it cannot read the pixels fast enough to keep up with the tiles' pace</b> <p>
